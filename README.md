# Multi-target Multiplicity

Code and data for "Multi-Target Multiplicity: Flexibility and Fairness in Target Specification under Resource Constraints", by Jamelle Watson-Daniels, Solon Barocas, Jake M. Hofman, and Alex Chouldechova (FAccT 2023)

The `Makefile` will run all code, generate results, and plot figures. This requires a license for the Gurobi solver. Alternatively you can just run the R scripts `plot_figure1.R`, `plot_figure2.R`, and `plot_figure3.R` to generate the figures using the provided results files.

All files in the `data/` directory are derived from the publicly released data for [Dissecting Racial Bias in an Algorithm Used to Manage the Health of Populations](https://gitlab.com/labsysmed/dissecting-bias) by Obermeyer et al.
